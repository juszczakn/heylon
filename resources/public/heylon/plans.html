    <h3>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Heylon plans to be an MMO based on the likes of Shadowmere.<br>
        <br>
        For those unfamiliar, this implies:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Heylon will be turn based, with player turns created every hour.</li>
            <li>
                Each player will be in control of one kingdom.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The player will control which race and location their kingdom has.<br>
                        Both of these will have a large impact on how the game will be played.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each kingdom will be composed of multiple villages. A village<br>
                        exists on a single parcel of land.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                The goal of the game is to expand your kingdom, however that may be.
                <ul>
                    <li>War</li>
                    <li>Trade</li>
                    <li>Diplomacy</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Races will have different bonuses, which will lend themselves to different playstyles.</li>
        </ul>
